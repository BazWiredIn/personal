                    <p class="cv__detail">Grade: A</p>
                    <p class="cv__detail cv__detail--muted"> This was my first CS class. I had never written a line of code before taking this class. That being said, this is the class that made me fall in love with programming. John Denero was a great instructor. To those who have been coding since they can walk, this class will really sharpen your coding intuition (recursion, classes, inheritance, etc.). To those who are going into this class having never coded before: practice past exam problems! The type of thought process needed for programming is quite different than non-programming classes, and the best way to learn it is through consistent practice. Building that intuition is not free, and this class is definitely not easy if you've never coded before, but dedicate a semester of consistency to this class, and I personally promise that you will come out of it for the better.</p>

                    <p class="cv__detail">Grade: A-</p>
                    <p class="cv__detail cv__detail--muted">This class is taught in Java, a great step in the right direction after python taught 61A as it introduces object-oriented programming concepts. CS61B has two parts to it in my opinion. The first is the content. One can completely learn the content and ace the exams, but the crux of this class is in the second part: projects! This might not mean much in the AI era, but I highly recommend for people to turn off the in-line suggestions and struggle through the projects. Struggle is what taught me the most, from modular design to understanding implementation of data structures and algorithms in real projects. Projects feed into understanding of the content and vise versa. </p>

                    <p class="cv__detail cv__detail--muted">Really an amazing class that showed me where digital abstractions meet physical reality. My semester (taught by Dan Garcia) moved quickly, starting with C as a step below Java, then diving into memory management and the mechanics of how programs actually run on hardware. Soon after, the course drops another layer down into assembly, exploring how C and assembly interact, and eventually how high-level code becomes ones and zeros. The highlight project is building a processor from scratch and implemeting pipelining. The class introduces a lot of these foundational ideas like caching, pipelining, and parallelism, but I didn’t fully appreciate some of them at the time. Topics like virtual memory, or the roles of the compiler, assembler, linker, and loader, were presented at a high level and only really clicked for me later after taking upper-division systems courses like CS162. Looking back, CS61C was less about mastery and more about exposure — it gave me the mental map that later courses filled in with detail. </p>

                    <p class="cv__detail">Grade: A-</p>
                    <p class="cv__detail cv__detail--muted">CS70 is a great introduction to discrete math and probability (as you can probably tell from the course title), but I think this class is a masterclass in logical reasoning and proof techniques. It's a very proof-heavy class, but it's also very rewarding. The course covers topics like modular arithmetic, graph theory, and probability distributions. The course is taught in a way that makes the proofs feel intuitive rather than abstract. I found the course to be very engaging and the material was very useful for later courses like Math110, CS170, and EECS126.</p>
